## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on **early and accurate detection of breast cancer** using a deep learning-based neural network.  
It classifies tumors as either **Benign** or **Malignant** based on fine-grained features extracted from biopsy data.

The aim is to help automate preliminary diagnosis and assist healthcare professionals.

## 🧬 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))
- **Features**: 30 numerical input features (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness).
- **Target Classes**: 
  - `0`: Malignant
  - `1`: Benign
- **Total Samples**: 569 instances.

## ⚙️ Features of This Project

- Deep Neural Network with 5 layers and **Dropout Regularization**.
- **EarlyStopping** and **ReduceLROnPlateau** callbacks to prevent overfitting.
- **Keras** model saving (`.keras`) and **scaler** serialization (`.pkl`).
- **Confusion Matrix**, **ROC Curve**, and **Training History** visualization.
- CSV Upload for batch predictions inside Colab.
- Manual patient input using **ipywidgets**.
- Highly modular scripts for training and inference.
